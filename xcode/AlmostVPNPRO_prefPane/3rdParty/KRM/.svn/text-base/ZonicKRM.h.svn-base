/*!    @header        ZonicKRM    @discussion       Kagi Registration Module by Zonic.              The ZonicKRM library provides the ability for applications to submit       payments to Kagi in real-time, and to obtain an immediate response       that can include a registration code for unlocking the application.              The user interface can be invoked as a modal dialog or a modeless       window. This window obtains the relevant information from the user       before submitting it to the Kagi Registration Server and returning       the result to the application.              The ZonicKRM is is distributed as a single static library, requires	   no additional resources or frameworks, and can be used from Mach-O	   or CFM applications packaged in either bundled or single-file form.    @copyright        Copyright 2004-2006 Zonic*//*    COPYRIGHT:        Copyright © 2004-2006, Zonic Ltd        <http://www.zonic.co.uk/>        If you have received this software as part of a source code        distribution from Zonic Ltd, subject to the limits of a        supporting contractual agreement, permission to use, copy,        modify, distribute, and sell this software for any purpose        is hereby granted.                Zonic retains full rights to this software.    ___________________________________________________________________________*/#ifndef ZONICKRM_HDR#define ZONICKRM_HDR//=============================================================================//      Include files//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#include <TargetConditionals.h>#if TARGET_RT_MAC_CFM    #include <Carbon.h>#else    #include <Carbon/Carbon.h>	#ifdef __OBJC__		#include <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>	#endif#endif#ifdef __cplusplusextern "C" {#endif#pragma pack(1)//=============================================================================//      Constants//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/*!    @enum        ZKRMLanguage    @discussion        Languages supported by the Zonic KRM.    @constant kZKRMLanguageSystem        The user interface will attempt to match the user's preferred language        for the system.

Even		with this option set they may experience spurious console output, caused by Cocoa		referencing the now-destroyed printer sheets.				This problem may be printer-driver specific, and appears to be more common on Mac OS		X 10.4. It has been logged with Apple, and a copy of the Radar reports are available		on request.*/typedef enum {    kZKRMOptionDefault              = 0,    kZKRMOptionOfferWebOrder        = (1 << 0),    kZKRMOptionEncryptedProductXML  = (1 << 1),    kZKRMOptionModalPrintDialogs    = (1 << 2),    kZKRMOptionSize32               = 0xFFFFFFFF} ZKRMOptions;/*!    @enum        ZKRMEvent    @discussion        Zonic KRM Carbon Event.    @constant kEventClassZKRM        The event class for Carbon Events generated by the Zonic KRM.    @constant kEventZKRMCompleted        The Zonic KRM has completed a transaction.    @constant kEventParamZKRMResult        A typeVoidPtr parameter which can be cast to a pointer to a ZKRMResult.*/typedef enum {    kEventClassZKRM                 = FOUR_CHAR_CODE('ZKrm'),    kEventZKRMCompleted             = 1,    kEventParamZKRMResult           = FOUR_CHAR_CODE('ZKre'),    kZKRMEventSize32                = 0xFFFFFFFF} ZKRMEvent;//=============================================================================//      Types//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------/*!    @struct        ZKRMKeyValuePair    @discussion        Holds a key-value pair.    @field key        The key for the key-value pair.            @field value        The value for the key-value pair.*/typedef struct ZKRMKeyValuePair {    CFStringRef         key;    CFStringRef         value;} ZKRMKeyValuePair;/*!    @struct        ZKRMParameters    @discussion        Configuration parameters passed to the Zonic KRM.    @field moduleVersion        The version number of this structure.
